# Credit-Scoring-Model-
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based credit scoring model that assesses the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses. The model will predict the likelihood of loan repayment or default, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, reduce risks, and optimize profits.
